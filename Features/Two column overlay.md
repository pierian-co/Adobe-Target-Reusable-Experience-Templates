First is scroll trigger, in which we can specify at which scroll percentage by user, template should be shown. Depth of the scroll is passed in percentage in 'depth' field. Second is timed trigger, in which can specify the time in miliseconds after which the template should be shown. Third is the exitIntent, turning its flag to true would trigger the template when user moves away from the tab.
